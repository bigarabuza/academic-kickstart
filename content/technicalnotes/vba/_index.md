VBA is an event-driven programming language embedded within Microsoft's Office Product tools. The language first appeared in 1993 and is still widely used in Office applications. Given its long history and wide array of libraries, this page serves as a collection of code snippets I use frequently particulary within Excel & Access. 

The official VBA reference can be found at the [Office VBA Reference Site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/)
